IpLookup
A simple command-line tool written in Go that performs DNS lookups using DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to resolve domain names to IP addresses.

Features
üîç DNS lookup using Cloudflare's secure DoH service (1.1.1.1)

üõ°Ô∏è HTTPS-encrypted DNS queries for privacy

üìù Interactive command-line interface

‚ö° Fast and lightweight

üéØ Simple A record resolution

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IpLookup.git
cd IpLookup
Build the application:

bash
go build -o iplookup
Usage
Interactive Mode
Run the application and follow the prompts:

bash
./iplookup
Example session:

text
Enter domain name (e.g., boot.dev): google.com
The IP address for google.com is: 142.250.191.14
Direct Execution
You can also run it directly with Go:

bash
go run .
How It Works
DNS-over-HTTPS: Uses Cloudflare's DoH service for secure DNS resolution

JSON Response Parsing: Parses DNS responses in JSON format

A Record Lookup: Resolves domain names to IPv4 addresses

Error Handling: Provides clear error messages for failed lookups

Technical Details
Go Version: 1.24.1

DNS Provider: Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)

Protocol: DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)

Record Type: A records (IPv4 addresses)

Dependencies
This project uses only Go standard library packages:

encoding/json - JSON parsing

fmt - Formatted I/O

io - I/O utilities

net/http - HTTP client

bufio - Buffered I/O

os - Operating system interface

strings - String utilities

Example API Response
The application parses DNS responses in this format:

json
{
  "Status": 0,
  "TC": false,
  "RD": true,  
  "RA": true,
  "AD": false,
  "CD": false,
  "Question": [
    {
      "name": "example.com",
      "type": 1
    }
  ],
  "Answer": [
    {
      "name": "example.com",
      "type": 1,
      "TTL": 300,
      "data": "93.184.216.34"
    }
  ]
}
Error Handling
The application handles various error scenarios:

Invalid HTTP requests

Network connectivity issues

JSON parsing errors

Empty DNS responses

Invalid domain names
